A Pokédex-esque app powered by PokéAPI

I do not own any of the Pokémon artwork, all the images belong to Game Freak, Nintendo & the Pokémon Company. They are merely stored locally to reduce load times (by using .webp instead of .png which drastically reduces their file size).

Images may not display on non-Chromium browsers that do not support .webp as an image format. 

Load times may vary, be sure to check the status of https://pokeapi.co as this is most likely a result of heavy load.
